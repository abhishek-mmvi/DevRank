    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Our Purpose</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
        IIITD Coders is a platform designed to help students track their coding progress, foster a competitive environment, and provide professional networking opportunities. Our goal is to create a community where IIITD students can showcase their coding achievements and connect with like-minded peers.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">How It Works</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Students can create an account and link their Codeforces, LeetCode, and GitHub profiles. Our platform automatically tracks their progress on these platforms and updates their rankings on our leaderboard. Users can search for other students, view profiles, and connect with peers who share similar interests in competitive programming.
